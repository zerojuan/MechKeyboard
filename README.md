# Mech Keyboard

## What it do?
* **Increase productivity** science tells us that people are more productive when they are able to drown the sound of meaningless work with loud keyboard taps
* **Save money** - the average mechanical keyboard costs around $200. You know what you can buy with $200? A lot if you ask the millions of people who live under a dollar a day.
* **Harmonize with coworkers** - everyone hates your MX-Clears. That's why they don't invite you to the fun hack-a-tons. Either that or the fact that you keep insisting on a standing desk.

## How much does it cost?
This appliance is **free**. Public Service.
